Project for GSoC 2017 - KDEnlive
===================


Scope of the standalone project

----------

Introduction
-------------

Currently there are some great tools for people with special needs, but many of them are difficult to access because they are expensive or not easy to handle.
Within this scenario, I can highlight people with blindness, dyslexia or some vision related problem. There are frameworks for converting text to audio, however there is no discrimination, for example, in a video with pre-defined captions. (Melhorar Definição)

Project goals
-------------------


> **Summary of activities to be completed during GSoC:**

> - In-depth understanding of MLT’s C++ API
> - Using tool like eSpeak to generate audio from subtitles inside KDEnlive
> - Use a ready or develop an algorithm to synchronize audio with video
> - Automatically calculate the voice volume so that the original video audio does not overlap completely
> - Designing and enhancing the user interface
> - Future developments: Deliver local and cloud audio processing


----------


Implementation
-------------

> - Initially the project aims to follow the development model proposed by the core developers of KDEnlive.
> - As the core of the program is the MLT, I will use your API to integrate eSpeak into it.
> - The fact that eSpeak is written in the same programming language (C / C ++), well documented and supports 99 languages (with Latin accents!), Will facilitate delivery within the stipulated deadline.

About me
-------------------

I am Caio Barros, student of Information Systems at the best computer college in central Brazil. Program for private companies for two years. I still work with server and datacenter infrastructure, but my biggest concern is with the well being of the community, especially for the disabled; I do everything in my power to improve their situation.
Supporting me in this initiative is my teacher Marcelo Akira.
